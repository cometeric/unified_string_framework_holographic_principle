The Unified String Framework Hologracpic Principle suggests that perhaps the Holopgraphic Principle is true in a way that the Unified String Framework https://github.com/cometeric/Unified-String-Framework-Theory can explain it.
This way is that as the strings move through nothing they with their forces, particles, space, time and energy project the universe as they move through nothing.
This would mean the Holographic Principle is real along with String Theory.
This could and would help us have a better understanding of the universe and everything.
